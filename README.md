## 📘 Philosophy

C is often dismissed as "legacy"—destined to be replaced. **This view ignores reality.**

The world's critical infrastructure is built on C. Experienced engineers don't hate C; they love it for its honesty. **Camelot** brings the "Senior Engineer" workflow to the forefront, stripping away the friction of the 1989 standard library to reveal the high-performance language underneath.

We believe in a transparent relationship between the engineer and the machine: strict control, zero hidden costs, and architectural clarity.
