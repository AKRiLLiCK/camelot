# Welcome to Camelot 🏰

Camelot is a custom C engine designed for **safety**, **speed**, and **predictability**.

## Why Camelot?

Standard C memory management (`malloc`/`free`) is prone to fragmentation and leaks. Camelot introduces a **Linear Arena System** that is:

* **Safe:** System allocators are poisoned by default.
* **Fast:** O(1) allocation and deallocation.
* **Secure:** Explicit result types for every operation.
